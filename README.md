Navmeshes for [NavBot](https://github.com/caxanga334/NavBot).

What is a Navmesh for NavBot? It's the same as a regular Navmesh, but for NavBot, a 3rd party bot system made for SourceMod. With some more customization for NavBot bots. Such as waypoints for specific location actions, like Sniper spots, sentry spots and more.
